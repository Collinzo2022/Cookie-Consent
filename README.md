# Cookie Consent Popup

A simple project to display a cookie consent popup using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This popup asks users for their cookie consent on their first visit and stores their choice (accept or decline) in the browserâ€™s local storage, ensuring the popup does not reappear on subsequent visits.

## Features

- Displays a cookie consent popup on the user's first visit.
- Stores user consent choice in `localStorage` for persistence across sessions.
- Hides the popup on subsequent visits if consent has already been given.

## How It Works

1. When the page loads, the script checks `localStorage` for a consent status.
2. If no status is found, the cookie consent banner is displayed.
3. When the user clicks "Accept" or "Decline," their choice is saved in `localStorage`, and the banner is hidden.
4. The banner does not reappear on future visits unless `localStorage` is cleared.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the cookie consent popup.
- **CSS**: Styling for the popup.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for displaying, hiding, and persisting user consent status.

## Project Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2. Open the project folder and run the HTML file   in a web browser.

## Code Explanation

The main JavaScript file contains the following logic:
- DOMContentLoaded: Ensures the script runs after the page has fully loaded.
- localStorage: Used to check and store the usr's consent choice, preventing
the popup from appearing again once consent is given.
- Even Listeners: Attach click events to "Accept" and "Decline" buttons too save the user's choice and hide the banner.
